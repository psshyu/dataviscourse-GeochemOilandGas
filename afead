Click in basin polygon:
                        -> zoom in that basin;
                        -> move to the upper right corner;
                        ->filter data of the wells in the clicked basin and pass it to the update function of the plots/charts;

Click in sample (circle/bar element)  :

                       -> in map, highlight the well location that corresponds to the clicked/hovered sample.

TA suggested:

                        -> Add more functionality to the vis system by adding a dropdown box/brush that allows to filter the data and
                       let evaluate it from different perspectives.

Extra:
                        -> Add a slider and work with temporal time (column age)
                        -> Add tooltips where convenient

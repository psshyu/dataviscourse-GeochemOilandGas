VISUALIZATION WORK FLOW:


1) ON THE MAP

Click in basin polygon:
                        -> zoom in that basin;
                        -> move to the upper right corner;
                        ->filter data of the wells in the clicked basin and pass it to the update function of the plots/charts;
                        -> Display screen 2 (4 charts)


2) ON SCREEN 2

If hovered over a well location:
                                -> Tooltip: well name

The TOC bar chart will be built per formation

If click in a bar (formation):   -> Highlight the data points in the other charts that correspond to this formation
                                -> Gray out the other colors
                                -> Highlight the well locations in the map (basin focus) that have this clicked formation as a parameter


If click in one of those highlited well locations:

                        -> highlight the samples (circles in the scatteplots that correspond only to this well.
                        -> Display depth chart with detailed information


If click in sample (circle in the scatterplot)  :

                       -> in map, highlight the well location that corresponds to the clicked/hovered sample.

--------------------------------------


TA suggested (If there's time):

                        -> Add more functionality to the vis system by adding a dropdown box/brush that allows to filter the data and
                       let evaluate it from different perspectives.

Extra:
                        -> Add a slider and work with temporal time (column age)


NOTE:

Stacked barchart has been redesigned to simple barchart which shows average TOC for the whole basin.

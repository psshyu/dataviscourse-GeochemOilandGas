# U.S. Source Rock Geochemistry Visualization System
### CS 6630 - Fall 2018
### Pablo Napan & Skylar Shyu

The plan is to give our users a birds-eye/detailed view of
the U.S. source rocks geochemical data (TOC, S1, S2, etc.) by displaying the data interactively
so it facilitates geoscientists in the analysis/exploration of the data at different
scales: data point, oil well and basin-wise.

*The data is property of the Energy and Geoscience Institute at the University of Utah. Currently, the dataset values/names have been modified
for confidentiality purposes.

# U.S. Source Rock Geochemistry Visualization System
### CS 6630 - Fall 2018
### Pablo Napan & Skylar Shyu

Project description:

The plan is to give our users a birds-eye/detailed view of
the U.S. source rocks geochemical data (TOC, S1, S2, etc.) by displaying the data interactively
so it facilitates geoscientists in the analysis/exploration of the data at different
scales: data point, oil well and basin-wise.

Features:

For this purpose we have implemented two screens:

Screen #1:

The points represent the well and outcrop locations across the U.S. from where the samples were taken; and the polygons show the
geoprovinces that contain this samples (This clasification was made by the USGS).





*The data is property of the Energy and Geoscience Institute at the University of Utah. The data values have been modified
for confidentiality purposes.

Overview:

We are handing in:

- Process book (.pdf)
- Feedback Excersise (.pdf)
- /Data: Contains the geospatial table for the geochemical samples and the table containing the geochemical description of those samples.
- /img: Reference images (from our design) that we use to guide our implementation.
- /js: Contains the js code for this project.
